# Game Balance Notes

1. synergies for matching multiple pixels (eg 3 shooters in a row increases shoot time or something)
2. penalty for tall/long/square ships? if you build a stack of shooters they'll just win every time
3. energy budget!!! each pixel uses a different amount of energy, you can add generator pixels for more budget! that's the balance!!!
